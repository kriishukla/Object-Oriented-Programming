Advantages of using OO
1.Easier to map problem in mind and get a framework
2.Easy debugging
3.less typing due to self 
Advantages of using Dictionaries
1.Easily access item by keys key value make it easier for user
2.make procees much Faster even in lecture we saw how fast it is
3.makes code much much smaller in size


Disadvantage of using OO
1.it is difficult to understand for a beigneer
2.Size of program is comparatively larger
3.quite slow in its process

Disadvantage of using dictionaries
1.Can not iterate it as it is unordered
2.Debugging is tough in dictionary
3.concatenation is tough in dictionaries

Performance comparison for grading operation (give in each line: value of N; time taken by two approaches in seconds, and which is faster and by how much).
1. N:1000
2. Time by OO: 8008169.662121 ms
3. Time by dictionary: 30416796.8695
4. X is faster; fraction of time x took is: X == dictionary

                                        dictionary
                                       ------------ == 0.26328116325
                                            OOP
